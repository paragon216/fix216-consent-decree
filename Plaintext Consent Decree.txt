XII. SUPERVISION
A. Duties, and Training of First Line Supervisors
322. CDP will ensure that first line supervisors provide close and effective supervision of
officers. This close and effective supervision includes responding to, investigating, and
documenting force as required by this Agreement; ensuring that officers are working
actively to engage the community with the goal of increasing public trust; monitoring,
commanding, and controlling incidents and calls for service; reviewing arrest reports
for compliance with law and this Agreement; identifying training and professional
development needs; and providing leadership, counseling, redirection, and support to
officers as needed.
323. Within 365 days of the Effective Date, CDP will develop and implement mandatory
supervisory training for all new and current supervisors. This training for new and
current supervisors may be different, but both will be adequate in quality, quantity,
type, and scope, and will include the following topics:
a. techniques for effectively guiding and directing officers and promoting
effective and constitutional police practices;
b. de-escalating conflict;
74 
c. evaluating written reports, including identification of canned or conclusory
language that is not accompanied by specific facts;
d. investigating officer uses of force;
e. building community partnerships and guiding officers on this requirement;
f. understanding supervisory tools such as the Officer Intervention Program and
body worn cameras;
g. responding to and investigating allegations of officer misconduct;
h. evaluating officer performance;
L consistent disciplinary sanction and non-punitive corrective action;
J. monitoring use of force to ensure consistency with policies; and
k. legal updates.
324. Thereafter all sworn supervisors will receive adequate in-service management training,
which may include updates and lessons learned related to the topics covered in the
supervisor training and other areas covered by this Agreement.
325. CDP will hold supervisors directly accountable for the quality and effectiveness of their
supervision, including whether supervisors identify and effectively respond to
misconduct and ensure that officers effectively engage with the community.
B. Officer Intervention Program
326. Within 365 days of the Efiective Date, CPD will create a plan to modify its Officer
Intervention Program ("OlP") to enhance its effectiveness as a management tool to
promote supervisory awareness and proactive identification of potentially problematic
behavior among officers.
327. CDP supervisors will regularly use OIP data to evaluate the performance of CDP
officers across all ranks, units, and shifts. Non~medical CDP supervisors will not have
access to confidential medical or mental health information or treatment plans. CDP
supervisors will be trained to interpret OIP data; understand and utilize the range of
non-disciplinary corrective action they can take to modify officers' behavior and
improve performance; manage risk and liability; promote constitutional policing; and
address underlying stressors to promote officer well-being. The intent of OIP is to
intervene before discipline is required.
75 
328. The OIP will include a computerized relational database that will be used to collect,
maintain, integrate, and retrieve data department-wide and for each officer regarding:
a. all uses of force;
b. all ECW applications and accidental discharges involving a subject;
c. all injuries and deaths to persons in custody;
d. all cri tical firearm discharges;
e. incidents involving the reportable pointing of a firearm at a person;
f. the number of OC spray applications;
g. canine bites;
h. vehicle pursuits and traffic collisions involving CDP equipment;
1. civilian complaints, whether filled with CDP, OPS, or the Mayor's office;
j. judicial proceedings where an officer is the subject of a protective or
restraining order, other than a temporary restraining order dealing solely with
financial matters. Officers will be required to report to their supervisors if
they become the subject of a protective or restraining order, other than a
temporary restraining order dealing solely with financial matters;
k. failures to record incidents with CDP's body worn cameras that are required
to be recorded under CDP's body worn camera policy;
I. instances in which CDP is informed that a court has made a negative
credibility determination regarding a CDP officer, or that a motion was
granted on the grounds of a constitutional violation by a CDP officer;
m. all disciplinary action taken against officers;
n. all documented non-disciplinary corrective action required of officers;
o. sick leave usage, especially in concert with regular days off and holidays; and
p. all criminal proceedings initiated against an officer, and all civil lawsuits
served upon the City and/or its officers or agents. resulting from the actions of
CDP officers.
329. CDP will set threshold levels for each OIP indicator that will trigger a formal review,
and the thresholds will allow for peer-group comparisons between officers with similar
assignments and duties. The Monitor and DOJ will review and approve the OIP
threshold levels.
76 
330. CDP will implement rolling thresholds so that, once a review of a particular officer has
been triggered as a result of a specific criteria that resulted in an intervention, each
subsequent event involving that same criteria will trigger a review for a specified period
of time.
331. CDP will collect and, at least quarterly, analyze OIP information related to supervisor,
District, squad, and unit trends.
332. OIP will include appropriate identifying information for each involved employee (i.e.,
name, badge number, shift, and supervisor) and, where appropriate, each involved
civilian (e.g., race, ethnicity, national origin, and gender).
333. CDP will develop and implement a comprehensive protocol for using the updated OIP
information that will include data storage, data retrieval, reporting, data analysis,
pattern identification, supervisory use, supervisory/departmental intervention,
documentation, audits, access to the system, and confidentiality of personally
identifiable information, medical and mental health records and treatment plans.
334. Supervisors will review OIP data other than confidential medical or mental health
records and treatment plans, for all officers under their direct command at least
monthly, and whenever an employee first comes under their supervision. At least
quarterly, supervisors will review broader, pattern-based reports.
335. Interventions in response to threshold triggers will be timely implemented and designed
to assist officers in avoiding potentially problematic behavior. All interventions will be
documented in writing and entered into OIP. Supervisors will review the progress and
evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention strategy except for those interventions that
relate to confidential medical and mental health treatment plans.
336. CDP will enter information into OIP in a timely, accurate, and complete manner, and
will securely and confidentially store all data. CDP will maintain all officer specific
information in OIP for at least five years following the officer's separation from CDP,
unless prohibited by law. Information necessary for aggregate statistical analyses will
be maintained indefinitely. CDP will provide in-service training to all employees,
including officers, supervisors, and commanders, regarding the updated OIP within 180
days of the system improvements specified in this section to ensure proper
understanding and use of the system. CDP supervisors will be trained to use OIP as
designed to help improve the performance of officers under their command.
Commanders and supervisors will be trained in evaluating and making appropriate
comparisons in order to identify any significant individual or group patterns.
C. Body Worn Cameras
337. CDP's use of body worn cameras is not required by this Agreement. If CDP chooses to
use body worn cameras, CDP will provide clear guidance and training on their use, and
will implement protocols for testing equipment and preservation of recordings to foster
transparency, increase accountability, and build trust, while protecting the privacy
rights of individuals.
338. Supervisors will review recordings related to any incident involving at least a Level 2
or 3 use of force; injuries to officers; and in conjunction with any other supervisory
investigation.
339. Supervisors will conduct adequate random and directed audits of body worn camera
recordings created by officers under their command to confirm compliance with CDP
policy and to identify areas where additional training or guidance is needed.
Supervisors will incorporate the knowledge gained from this review into their ongoing
evaluation and supervision of officers.
340. Officers will be subject to the disciplinary process for intentional or otherwise
unjustified failure to activate body worn cameras in violation of CDP policy.
XIII. POLICIES
341. To maintain high quality service, ensure officer safety and accountability, and promote
constitutional, effective policing, CDP will ensure that its policies and procedures
reflect and express CDP's commitment to building community trust, utilizing
community and problem-oriented policing, ensuring bias-free policing, and
incorporating the concept of procedural justice.
342. As needed, CDP will develop, revise, and implement policies and procedures to fully
incorporate the terms of this Agreement and comply with applicable law. CDP will
ensure that its policies and procedures are plainly written, logically organized, and use
terms that are clearly defined. Unless otherwise noted, CDP will develop all policies
and procedures pursuant to this Agreement within 365 days of the Effective Date.
78 
343. CDP will ensure that officers from all varying ranks and units have a meaningful
opportunity to review and comment on new or existing policies and procedures.
344. Prior to submission to the Monitor and DOJ, CDP will provide policies related to bias-free
policing, use of force, search and seizure, and data collection and retention to the
Commission for review and comment. The Commission will provide any comments to
CDP within l5 days of submission. The CDP will consider, discuss with, and timely
respond to the Commission's concerns. Where the Commission's concerns are
unresolved, CDP will provide the Commission's comments to the DOJ and the Monitor
along with the policy when it is submitted for approval.
345. CDP will submit all policies, procedures, manuals, and other administrative orders or
directives related to this Agreement to the Monitor and DOJ prior to publication and
implementation. If the Monitor or DOJ objects to the proposed policy, procedure,
manual, or other administrative order or directive because they do not incorporate the
requirements of this Agreement or are inconsistent with this Agreement or law, the
Monitor or DOJ will note this objection in writing to all Parties within 15 business days
of the receipt of the policy, procedure, manual, or directive. CDP will have 15 business
days to resolve any objections to its policies, procedures, manuals, or directives. If,
after this 15 day period has run, the Monitor or DOJ maintains its objection, then the
Monitor will have an additional 15 business days to resolve the objection. If either
party disagrees with the Monitor's resolution of the objection, either party may ask the
Court to resolve the matter. The policies will not be published or implemented until
any objections have been resolved. The Monitor will determine whether an additional
amount of time is necessary to ensure full and proper review of policies. Factors to
consider in making this determination include: (a) complexity of the policy; (b) extent
of disagreement regarding policy; (c) number of policies provided simultaneously; or
(d) extraordinary circumstances delaying review by the DOJ or the Monitor. In
determining whether these factors warrant additional time for review, the Monitor will
fully consider the importance of prompt implementation of policies and will allow
additional time for policy review only where it is clear that additional time is necessary
to ensure full and proper review. Any extension to the above timelines by the Monitor
will also toll CDP's deadline for policy completion.
 
346. CDP will post approved policies and procedures on the City's website to ensure public
accessibility. There will be reasonable exceptions for policies, procedures, and
administrative orders that are law enforcement sensitive, such as procedures regarding
undercover officers or operations.
347. The CDP will review each policy or procedure related to this Agreement six months
after it is implemented and annually thereafter, to ensure that the policy or procedure
provides effective direction to CDP personnel and remains consistent with this
Agreement, and current law. The CDP will review and revise policies and procedures
as necessary upon notice of a significant policy deficiency during audits or reviews.
348. CDP will maintain a complete, up-to-date manual of all CDP policies and procedures
that is indexed and maintained in an organized manner using a uniform numbering
system for ease of reference. Officers and employees will have access to the manual, in
hard copy or electronic format. Revisions and updates to CDP policies and procedures
will be incorporated into the manual.
349. CDP will ensure that changes in case law and statutes that are relevant to the work of
CDP are disseminated to appropriate CDP personnel in a timely manner and
incorporated, as needed, into CDP policies, procedures, and training.
XIV. IMPLEMENTATION, ASSESSMENT, OUTCOMES, AND ENFORCEMENT
A. Role of the Independent Monitor
350. The Parties will jointly select an Independent Monitor ("Monitor") who will assess and
report whether the requirements of this Agreement have been implemented, and
whether this implementation is resulting in constitutional and effective policing,
professional treatment of individuals, and increased community trust of CDP. The
Monitor will work with the Parties to identify and address any barriers to compliance.
35 1. The Monitor will only have the duties, responsibilities, and authority conferred by this
Agreement. The Monitor will not, and is not intended to, replace or assume the role
and duties of any CDP employee, including the Chief, or any other City official.
Nothing in this Agreement alters the fact that the Mayor of Cleveland retains authority
over the CDP and the Chief of CDP maintains the authority to oversee the operations of
CDP. As an agent of the Court, the Monitor will be subject to the supervision and
80 
orders of the Court, consistent with this Agreement and applicable law.
352. In order to assess and report on CD P's implementation of this Agreement and whether
the goals of this Agreement are being achieved, the Monitor will conduct the reviews
specified in this Agreement, and will review CDP policies, procedures, practices,
training curricula, and programs developed and implemented under this Agreement.
B. Selection and Compensation of the Monitor
353. Within 90 days of the Effective Date, or additional time if agreed to by the Parties, the
City and DOJ will together select a Monitor, acceptable to both Parties, to assess and
report on CDP's implementation of this Agreement. The Parties have agreed to use an
open Request for Information process in selecting the Monitor. This process will be
implemented in a manner consistent with this Agreement, including the requirement
that the Monitor be jointly selected and acceptable to both DOJ and the City. The
Parties' Monitor selection will be subject to the approval of the Court with jurisdiction
over this Agreement. The Monitor will be comprised of individuals of the highest
ethics.
354. If the Parties are unable to agree on a Monitor or an alternative method of selection
within the timeframe agreed to by the Parties, each Party will submit the names of three
candidates, or three groups of candidates, along with resumes and cost proposals, to the
Cou1t, and the Court will select a Monitor from among the qualified
candidates/candidate groups.
355. The Monitor will be appointed for a period of five years from the Effective Date and
wi ll have its appointment extended automatically should the City and CDP not
demonstrate Substantial and Effective Compliance at the end of this five-year period.
The extension of the Monitor beyond seven years will be allowed only if the Court
determines that it is reasonably necessary in order to assess and faci litate Substantial
and Effective Compliance with this Agreement. The Monitor's appointment will
terminate prior to five years if the City has achieved Substantial and Effective
Comp I iance for the time specified in paragraph 401.
356. The City will bear all reasonable fees and costs of the Monitor. DOJ and the City
recognize the importance of ensuring that the fees and costs borne by the City arc
81 
reasonable, and accordingly fees and costs will be one factor to be considered in
selecting the Monitor. In the event that any dispute ari.ses regarding the reasonableness
or payment of lhe Monitor's fees and costs, the City, DOJ, and the Monitor will attempt
to resolve such dispute cooperatively prior to seeking the assistance of the Court. If the
City and DO.I agree, and the Court approves, an independent third party with no
financial interest in the case may pay some or all of the fees and costs of the Monitor.
357. The City will provide the Monitor with permanent office space and reasonable office
support such as office furniture, telephones, lntemet access, secure document storage,
and photocopying.
358. The Monitor, at any time after its initial selection, may request to be allowed to h:ire,
employ, or contract with such additional persons or entities as are reasonably necessary
to perform the tasks assigned to the Monitor by this Agreement. Any person or entity
hired or otherwise retained by the Monitor to assist in furthering any provision of this
Agreement will be subject to the provisions of this Agreement. The Monitor will notify
the City and DOJ in writing if the Monitor wishes to select such additional persons or
entities. The notice will identify and describe the qualifications of the person or entity
to be hired or employed and the monitoring task to be perfo rmed. If the City and DOJ
agree with the Monitor's proposal, the Monitor will be authorized to hire or employ
such additional persons or entities. The City and the DOJ have ten business days to
disagree with any such proposal. If the City and DOJ are unable to reach agreement
within ten business days of receiving notice of the disagreement, the Court wi 11 resolve
the dispute.
359. Should any of the Parties to this Agreement determine that the Monitor's individual
members, agents, employees, or independent contractors have exceeded their authority,
or failed to satisfactorily perfonn the duties required by this Agreement, the Party may
petition the Court for such relief as the Court deems appropriate, including replacement
.of the Monitor, and/or any individual members, agents, employees, or independent
contractors.
C. Compliance Reviews
360. The Monitor will conduct reviews or audits as necessary to determine whether the City
82 
and CDP have complied with the requirements of this Agreement. Compliance requires
that the City and CDP: (a) have incorporated the requirement into policy; (b) have
trained all relevant personnel as necessary to fulfill their responsibil ities pursuant to the
requirement; and (c) are carrying out the requirement in actual practice. Compliance
reviews and audits will contain the elements necessary for reliability and
comprehensiveness. Compliance reviews and audits may be conducted using sampling
and compilation data where appropriate.
0 . Biennial Community Survey
361. Within 180 days of the Effective Date, and every two years thereafter, the Monitor will
conduct a reliable, comprehensive, and representative survey of members of the
Cleveland community regarding their experiences with and perceptions of CDP and of
public safety. Analysis of the results of this survey will be included in the outcome
assessments that are described in paragraph 367 and that may be used to demonstrate
sustained compliance with this Agreement.
362. The City and DOJ will endeavor to secure private funding for the biennial community
survey.
363. To conduct the biennial community survey, the Monitor will :
a. develop a baseline of measures on public satisfaction with policing, attitudes
among police personnel, and the quality of police-citizen encounters;
b. design, conduct, and analyze baseline and subsequent biennial surveys of a
representative sample of City residents, pol ice personnel, and detained
arrestees;
c. review and consider prior law enforcement surveys in Cleveland and other
cities, as well as current or recent concerns in Cleveland, in designing the
survey;
d. observe community meetings and engage in informal conversations with
Cleveland residents, CDP officers and command staff, and other relevant
individuals, including DOJ epresent~t ves during the pendency of this
Agreement;
83 
e. ensure that the resident and arrestee surveys are designed to capture a
representative sample of Cleveland residents, including members of each
demographic category;
f. conduct the survey in English, Spanish, and other languages, as necessary, to
ensure representation of the entire Cleveland community; and
g. fo rmally discuss the survey methodology with CDP supervisors and DOJ
representatives, throughout the pcndency of this Agreement. and consider
these opinions in the development of the initial survey and in making
improvements to subsequent surveys.
364. CDP and the City agree to cooperate with the design and perfonnance of the survey.
365. The report of the baseline survey and subsequent biennial surveys will be posted to the
City's website, and publicly distributed.
366. CDP will analyze the results of the survey and will use this analysis to modify and
improve CDP policies, procedures, practices, and protocols, as needed.
E. Outcome Measurements
367. In addition to compliance reviews and audits, the Monitor will conduct qualitative and
quantitative assessments to measure whether implementing this Agreement has resulted
in constitutional policing. The measurements relating to use of force; addressing
individuals in crisis; and stop, search, and arrest are not intended to expand the City's
data collection requirements set forth elsewhere in the Agreement. These outcome
assessments will include collecting and analyzing. at least annually, the following
outcome data, trends, and patterns:
a. Use of fo rce measurements, including:
1. number of use-of-force incidents as compared to number of arrests, with

the amount of judgments against or settlements resulting from those civil
suits.
J. Jn conducting these outcome assessments, the Monitor may use any relevant
data collected and maintained by CDP or the City (e.g., crime trend pattern
analysis), provided that the Monitor has determined, and the Parties agree, that
this data is reasonably reliable and complete.
F. Monitoring Plan and Review Methodology
368. Within 90 days of assuming the duties as the Monitor, the Monitor wi ll review and
recommend any changes to the outcome measures detai led above that the Monitor
deems useful in assessing whether implementation of this Agreement is resulling in
constitutional policing. Recognizing that the above outcome measures have been
negotiated and agreed to by the Parties, the Parties will move the Court to adopt any
recommendations upon which they agree.
369. Within 120 days of assuming the duties as the Monitor, the Monitor will develop a plan
for conducting the compliance reviews and outcome assessments, and will submit this
plan to the Parties for review and approval. This plan will:
a. clearly delineate the requirements of this Agreement to be assessed for
compliance, indicating which requirements wi.11 be assessed together;
b. set out a schedule for conducting outcome measure assessments for each outcome
measure at least annually, except where otherwise noted, with the first assessment
occurring within 365 days of the Effective Date; and
c. set out a schedule fo r conducting a compliance review or audit of each
requirement of this Agreement within the first two years of this Agreement, and a
compliance review or audit of each requirement at least annually thereafter, unless
the Monitor no longer assesses that requirement as provided in the next
paragraph.
88 
370. Where the Monitor recommends and the Parties agree, the Monitor may refrain from
conducting a compliance review of a requirement previously found to be in compliance
by the Monitor, or where outcome assessments indicate that the outcome intended by
the requirement has been achieved. The City and CDP will be deemed to have
achieved Substantial and Effective Compliance on those requirements and the City's
obligations under those provisions will be deemed to have been met for the purpose of
seeking termination of this Agreement, without considering the one or two year
sustained compliance requirement.
37 1. /\t least 90 days prior to the initiation or any outcome measure assessment, compliance
review. or audit, the Monitor will submit a proposed methodology for the assessment,
review, or audit to the Parties. The Parties will submit any comments or concerns
regarding the proposed methodology to the Monitor no later than 45 days prior to the
proposed date of the assessment, review, or audit. The Monitor will modify the
methodology as necessary to address any concerns or will inform the Parties in writing
or the reasons it is not modifying its proposed methodology. Any unresolved disputes
involving the Monitor's methodology may be submitted to the Court for resolution.
G. Monitor Recommendations and Technical Assistance
372. The Monitor may make recommendations to the Parties regarding actions necessary to
ensure timely Substantial and Effective compliance with this Agreement and its
underlying objectives. Such recommendations may include a recommendation to
change, modify, or amend a provision of this Agreement, a recommendation for
additional training in any area related to this Agreement, or a recommendation to seek
technical assistance. In addition to such recommendations, the Monitor may also, at the
request of DOJ or the City and based on the Monitor's reviews, provide technical
assistance consistent with the Monitor's responsibilities under tru s Agreement.
3 73. In the event that Substantial and Effecti ve Compliance with this Agreement requires
technical assistance beyond the scope of the Monitor's duties, DOJ, CDP, and/or the
Monitor will inform the Parties of the need for technical assistance and its relation to
compliance with this Agreement. The Monitor, with assistance from the City, will
arrange for the prompt initiation of the required technical assistance, to be performed
89 
by the Monitor, its agent, independent contractor, or a separate entity. The cost for the
technical assistance will be borne by the City. If any Party disagrees with the need for
the requested technical assistance, the Party will, within IS days of being informed in
writing of the requested technical assistance, inform the Court, which will resolve the
dispute.
H. Comprehensive Reassessment
374. Two years and six months after the Effecti ve Date, the Monitor will conduct a
comprehensive outcome assessment to determine whether and to what extent the
outcomes intended by this /\greement are being achieved, and vvhether any
modifications to this Agreement are necessary for achievement in light of changed
circumstances or unanticipated impact (or lack of impact) of the requirement. The
Monitoring Plan will provide that this comprehensive outcome assessment will
coincide with an annual outcome assessment as required in paragraph 367. This
assessment also wi II address areas of greatest achievement and the requirements that
appear to have contributed to this success, as well as areas of greatest concern,
including strategies for accelerating Substantial and Effective Compliance. Based upon
this comprehensive assessment, the Monitor will recommend any modifications to this
Agreement necessary to achieve and sustain intended outcomes. Where the Parties
agree with the Monitor's recommendations, the Parties will move the Court to modify
this Agreement accordingly. This provision in no way diminishes the Parties' abil ity to
stipulate to modifications to this Agreement as set out below. Nothing in this
Assessment will enable the Monitor to unilaterally modify the terms of this Agreement.
I. Monitor Reports
375. The Monitor will file with the Court, every six months, written, public reports that
include the following:
a. a description of the work conducted by the Monitor during the reporting
period;
b. a list of each Agreement requirement, indicating which requirements have
been:
I. incorporated into policy;
90 
2. the subject of sufficient training for all relevant CDP officers and
employees; and
3. carried out in actual practice.
c. the methodology and specific findings for each compliance review conducted,
where appropriate, and redacted as necessary for privacy concerns. An
u11redacted version will be fil ed under seal with the Court and provided to the
Pa11ies. The underlying data for each compliance review will not be publicly
available but will be retained by the Monitor and provided to either or both
Parties upon request;
d. for any requirements that were reviewed or audited and fo und not to have
been implemented, the Monitor's recommendations regarding necessary steps
to achieve compliance;
e. the methodology and speci fie findings for each outcome assessment
conducted; and
f. a projection of the work to be completed during the upcoming reporting
period and any anticipated challenges or concerns related to compliance with
this Agreement.
376. The Monitor will provide a copy of the six-month reports to the Parties in draft form
within 15 business clays after the end of each reporting period. The Parties will have 15
business days upon receipt of the report to informally comment on the draft report. The
Monitor will consider the Parties' responses and make appropriate changes, if any,
before issuing the report.
